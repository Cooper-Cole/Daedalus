# Daedalus Report

## Description
### What?

Daedalus is a decentralized application assisting in the transfer of renewable energy. Daedalus is completely autonomous utilizing a smart contract and bidding system to buy and sell surpluses of energy. 

### Why?

The growth of renewable energy across the United States has grown 67% over the last twenty years. With this, there has been a surge in renewable energy projects. Unfortunately, the upfront cost of purchasing solar panels creates a barrier for entering the renewable energy market. With this project, we are eliminating the need for solar panels and ending the closed circuit energy system. For _suppliers_, this means generating additional revenue for owning solar panels and increasing the use of renewable energy without any additional manual efforts. For _consumers_, this allows them to receive energy that is cheaper and clean without the upfront cost of purchasing solar panels while eliminating the efforts to find renewable energy sources.

### How?

We achieved this by developing a smart contract, _Daedalus_, to initiate a contract and emit an event that allows potential consumers to bid. We use web3 to generate an autonomous system that enables people to transfer and receive money and energy.  

## Deliverables

1. _Daedalus_ smart contract
2. Autonomous Web3 backend
3. Demonstration of autonomous backend with two consumers bidding
4. Detailed documentation regarding _Daedalus_
