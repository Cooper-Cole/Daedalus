# Daedalus Report

## Description
### What? (10 pts)

Daedalus is a decentralized application assisting in the transfer of renewable energy. Daedalus is completely autonomous utilizing a smart contract and bidding system to buy and sell surpluses of energy. 

### Why? (10 pts)

The growth of renewable energy across the United States has grown 67% over the last twenty years. With this, there has been a surge in renewable energy projects. Unfortunately, the upfront cost of purchasing solar panels creates a barrier for entering the renewable energy market. With this project, we are eliminating the need for solar panels and ending the closed circuit energy system. For _suppliers_, this means generating additional revenue for owning solar panels and increasing the use of renewable energy without any additional manual efforts. For _consumers_, this allows them to receive energy that is cheaper and clean without the upfront cost of purchasing solar panels while eliminating the efforts to find renewable energy sources.

### How? (10 pts)

We achieved this by developing a smart contract, _Daedalus_, to initiate a contract and emit an event that allows potential consumers to bid. We use web3 to generate an autonomous system that enables people to transfer and receive money and energy.  

## Deliverables (10 pts)

1. _Daedalus_ smart contract
2. Autonomous Web3 backend
3. Demonstration of autonomous backend with two consumers bidding
4. Detailed documentation regarding _Daedalus_

## Getting Started (20 pts)
### Install
`git clone _daedalus_`
`npm install` 
### Run
`npm run compile`
`node deploy.js`

## Features (20 pts)
1. Smart Contract
2. Autonomous Web3 backend
3. Single command demo
4. Fully expandable Web3 API

## Demo video (20 pts)

Upload your demo video to youtube and put a link here. Basically, the video content is very much like the quick live demo you gave during your final presentation with the followings:
1. Project description
2. How to run the app
3. Quick walkthrough of all the features of your app

Make it short and interesting.
